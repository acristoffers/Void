# VOID

Void is an encrypted store. You can encrypt/decrypt files from/to the store. It
supports viewing images and editing text inside the application, without having
to decrypt to disk. Videos can be played easily, but will be unencrypted to a
temporary folder in disk.

You can also add tags and comments to the files, and search will lookup file
path, tags and comments.
